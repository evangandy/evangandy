## üöÄ Featured Projects

**Blackjack Strategy Analyzer**     
Built a simulation to test if card counting actually works in blackjack. Ran 50,000+ hands to analyze the mathematical edge gained through optimal play and bet sizing, demonstrating a 2.3% advantage that validates basic strategy combined with card counting techniques.

**Simple Greeks Learning Project ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Construction**     
Educational project exploring options pricing and the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) using Python. Implements Black-Scholes calculations and visualizations to understand how option values change with market conditions.
